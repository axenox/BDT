# Writing Features - Gherkin Language

Our automated UI tests are defined in feature files, that are written in a special language called Gherkin. Gherkin is well readable for humans and machines and widely used for test automation.

## Gherkin Syntax

Like YAML or Python, Gherkin is a line-oriented language that uses indentation
to define structure. Line endings terminate statements (called steps) and either
spaces or tabs may be used for indentation. (We suggest you use spaces for
portability.) Finally, most lines in Gherkin start with a special keyword:

```gherkin
    Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired
      In order to realize a named business value
      As an explicit system actor
      I want to gain some beneficial outcome which furthers the goal
    
      Scenario: Some determinable business situation
        Given some precondition
          And some other precondition
         When some action by the actor
          And some other action
          And yet another action
         Then some testable outcome is achieved
          And something else we can check happens too
    
      Scenario: A different situation
```

The parser divides the input into features, scenarios and steps. Let's walk
through the above example:

1. ``Feature: Some terse yet descriptive text of what is desired`` starts
   the feature and gives it a title. Learn more about features in the Features section.

2. Behat does not parse the next 3 lines of text. (In order to... As an...
   I want to...). These lines simply provide context to the people
   reading your feature, and describe the business value derived from the
   inclusion of the feature in your software.

3. ``Scenario: Some determinable business situation`` starts the scenario,
   and contains a description of the scenario. Learn more about scenarios in
   the "`Scenarios`" section.

4. The next 7 lines are the scenario steps, each of which is matched to
   a regular expression defined elsewhere. Learn more about steps in the
   "`Steps`" section.

5. ``Scenario: A different situation`` starts the next scenario, and so on.

When you're executing the feature, the trailing portion of each step (after
keywords like ``Given``, ``And``, ``When``, etc) is matched to
a regular expression, which executes a PHP callback function. You can read more
about steps matching and execution in :doc:`/guides/2.definitions`.

## Features

Every ``*.feature`` file conventionally consists of a single feature. Lines
starting with the keyword ``Feature:`` (or its localized equivalent) followed
by three indented lines starts a feature. A feature usually contains a list of
scenarios. You can write whatever you want up until the first scenario, which
starts with ``Scenario:`` (or localized equivalent) on a new line. You can use
`tags` to group features and scenarios together, independent of your file and
directory structure.

Every scenario consists of a list of `steps`, which must start with one of the
keywords ``Given``, ``When``, ``Then``, ``But`` or ``And`` (or localized one).
Behat treats them all the same, but you shouldn't. Here is an example:

```gherkin
    Feature: Serve coffee
      In order to earn money
      Customers should be able to 
      buy coffee at all times

      Scenario: Buy last coffee
        Given there are 1 coffees left in the machine
        And I have deposited 1 dollar
        When I press the coffee button
        Then I should be served a coffee
```

In addition to basic `scenarios`, feature may contain `scenario outlines` and `backgrounds`.

## Scenarios

Scenario is one of the core Gherkin structures. Every scenario starts with
the ``Scenario:`` keyword (or localized one), followed by an optional scenario
title. Each feature can have one or more scenarios, and every scenario consists
of one or more `steps`.

The following scenarios each have 3 steps:

```gherkin
  Scenario: Wilson posts to his own blog
    Given I am logged in as Wilson
    When I try to post to "Expensive Therapy"
    Then I should see "Your article was published."

  Scenario: Wilson fails to post to somebody else's blog
    Given I am logged in as Wilson
    When I try to post to "Greg's anti-tax rants"
    Then I should see "Hey! That's not your blog!"

  Scenario: Greg posts to a client's blog
    Given I am logged in as Greg
    When I try to post to "Expensive Therapy"
    Then I should see "Your article was published."
```

## Scenario Outlines

Copying and pasting scenarios to use different values can quickly become tedious and repetitive:

```gherkin
    Scenario: Eat 5 out of 12
      Given there are 12 cucumbers
      When I eat 5 cucumbers
      Then I should have 7 cucumbers

    Scenario: Eat 5 out of 20
      Given there are 20 cucumbers
      When I eat 5 cucumbers
      Then I should have 15 cucumbers
```

Scenario Outlines allow us to more concisely express these examples through the
use of a template with placeholders:

```gherkin
    Scenario Outline: Eating
      Given there are <start> cucumbers
      When I eat <eat> cucumbers
      Then I should have <left> cucumbers

      Examples:
        | start | eat | left |
        |  12   |  5  |  7   |
        |  20   |  5  |  15  |
```

The Scenario outline steps provide a template which is never directly run. A
Scenario Outline is run once for each row in the Examples section beneath it
(not counting the first row of column headers).

The Scenario Outline uses placeholders, which are contained within
``< >`` in the Scenario Outline's steps. For example:

```gherkin
    Given <I'm a placeholder and I'm ok>
```

Think of a placeholder like a variable. It is replaced with a real value from
the ``Examples:`` table row, where the text between the placeholder angle
brackets matches that of the table column header. The value substituted for
the placeholder changes with each subsequent run of the Scenario Outline,
until the end of the ``Examples`` table is reached.

> You can also use placeholders in `Multiline Arguments`.

    NOTE: Your step definitions will never have to match the placeholder text itself,
    but rather the values replacing the placeholder.

So when running the first row of our example:

```gherkin
    Scenario Outline: controlling order
      Given there are <start> cucumbers
      When I eat <eat> cucumbers
      Then I should have <left> cucumbers

      Examples:
        | start | eat | left |
        |  12   |  5  |  7   |
```

The scenario that is actually run is:

```gherkin
    Scenario Outline: controlling order
      # <start> replaced with 12:
      Given there are 12 cucumbers
      # <eat> replaced with 5:
      When I eat 5 cucumbers
      # <left> replaced with 7:
      Then I should have 7 cucumbers
```

## Backgrounds

Backgrounds allows you to add some context to all scenarios in a single
feature. A Background is like an untitled scenario, containing a number of
steps. The difference is when it is run: the background is run before each of
your scenario.

```gherkin
    Feature: Multiple site support

      Background:
        Given a global administrator named "Greg"
        And a blog named "Greg's anti-tax rants"
        And a customer named "Wilson"
        And a blog named "Expensive Therapy" owned by "Wilson"

      Scenario: Wilson posts to his own blog
        Given I am logged in as Wilson
        When I try to post to "Expensive Therapy"
        Then I should see "Your article was published."

      Scenario: Greg posts to a client's blog
        Given I am logged in as Greg
        When I try to post to "Expensive Therapy"
        Then I should see "Your article was published."
```

## Steps

`Features` consist of steps, also known as `Given`s, `When`s and `Then`s.

Behat doesn't technically distinguish between these three kind of steps.
However, we strongly recommend that you do! These words have been carefully
selected for their purpose, and you should know what the purpose is to get into
the BDD mindset.

Robert C. Martin has written a [great post](https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/the-truth-about-bdd)
about BDD's Given-When-Then concept where he thinks of them as a finite state
machine.

### Givens

The purpose of **Given** steps is to **put the system in a known state** before
the user (or external system) starts interacting with the system (in the When
steps). Avoid talking about user interaction in givens. If you have worked with use cases, givens are your preconditions.

And for all the symfony users out there, we recommend using a Given step with a
`tables` arguments to set up records instead of fixtures. This way you can
read the scenario all in one place and make sense out of it without having to
jump between files:

```gherkin
    Given there are users:
      | username | password | email               |
      | everzet  | 123456   | everzet@knplabs.com |
      | fabpot   | 22@222   | fabpot@symfony.com  |
```

### Whens

The purpose of **When** steps is to **describe the key action** the user
performs (or, using Robert C. Martin's metaphor, the state transition).

### Thens

The purpose of **Then** steps is to **observe outcomes**. The observations
should be related to the business value/benefit in your feature description.
The observations should inspect the output of the system (a report, user
interface, message, command output) and not something deeply buried inside it
(that has no business value and is instead part of the implementation).

* Verify that something related to the Given+When is (or is not) in the output
* Check that some external system has received the expected message (was an
  email with specific content successfully sent?)

```gherkin
    When I call "echo hello"
    Then the output should be "hello"
```

While it might be tempting to implement Then steps to just look in the
database â€“ resist the temptation. You should only verify output that is
observable by the user (or external system). Database data itself is
only visible internally to your application, but is then finally exposed
by the output of your system in a web browser, on the command-line or an
email message.

### And, But

If you have several Given, When or Then steps you can write:

```gherkin
    Scenario: Multiple Givens
      Given one thing
      Given an other thing
      Given yet an other thing
      When I open my eyes
      Then I see something
      Then I don't see something else
```

Or you can use **And** or **But** steps, allowing your Scenario to read more fluently:

```gherkin
    Scenario: Multiple Givens
      Given one thing
      And an other thing
      And yet an other thing
      When I open my eyes
      Then I see something
      But I don't see something else
```

If you prefer, you can indent scenario steps in a more *programmatic* way, much
in the same way your actual code is indented to provide visual context:

```gherkin
    Scenario: Multiple Givens
      Given one thing
        And an other thing
        And yet an other thing
      When I open my eyes
      Then I see something
        But I don't see something else
```

Behat interprets steps beginning with And or But exactly the same as all other
steps. It doesn't differ between them - you should!

## Multiline Arguments

The regular expression matching in `steps` lets you capture small strings from
your steps and receive them in your step definitions. However, there are times
when you want to pass a richer data structure from a step to a step definition.

This is what multiline step arguments are for. They are written on lines
immediately following a step, and are passed to the step definition method as
the last argument.

Multiline step arguments come in two flavours: `tables` or `pystrings`.

### Tables

Tables as arguments to steps are handy for specifying a larger data set -
usually as input to a Given or as expected output from a Then.

```gherkin

    Scenario:
      Given the following people exist:
        | name  | email           | phone |
        | Aslak | aslak@email.com | 123   |
        | Joe   | joe@email.com   | 234   |
        | Bryan | bryan@email.org | 456   |
```

> Don't be confused with tables from `scenario outlines` - syntactically they are identical, but have a different purpose.

### PyStrings

Multiline Strings (also known as PyStrings) are handy for specifying a larger
piece of text. This is done using the so-called PyString syntax. The text
should be offset by delimiters consisting of three double-quote marks
(``"""``) on lines by themselves:

```gherkin
    Scenario:
      Given a blog post named "Random" with:
        """
        Some Title, Eh?
        ===============
        Here is the first paragraph of my blog post.
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing
        elit.
        """
```

Indentation of the opening ``"""`` is not important, although common practice
is two spaces in from the enclosing step. The indentation inside the triple
quotes, however, is significant. Each line of the string passed to the step
definition's callback will be de-indented according to the opening ``"""``.
Indentation beyond the column of the opening ``"""`` will therefore be
preserved.

## Tags

Tags are a great way to organize your features and scenarios. Consider this
example:

```gherkin
    @billing
    Feature: Verify billing

      @important
      Scenario: Missing product description

      Scenario: Several products
```

A Scenario or Feature can have as many tags as you like, just separate them
with spaces:

```gherkin
    @billing @bicker @annoy
    Feature: Verify billing
```

> If a tag exists on a ``Feature``, Behat will assign that tag to all child ``Scenarios`` and ``Scenario Outlines`` too.
